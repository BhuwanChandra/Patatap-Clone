# Patatap-Clone

* This is a Simple Clone of the website <a href="patatap.com">Patatap.com</a>
* In this app, when you press a key between A-Z there will be a sound and some animation seen on the output screen
* Two external javascript libraries Paper.js and Howler.js was used in this project
> Paper.js is used to make some simple animations like for making circles and to shrink and then disappear 
> Howler.js is used to play different sounds on pressing different keys
